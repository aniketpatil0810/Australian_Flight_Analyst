# 2. Project Description
The **Flight Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive Power BI report built to analyze key aviation metrics such as **flight volume**, **route trends**, **delay patterns**, **airport performance**, 
and **passenger movement** across different time periods.

This project turns raw flight operational data into meaningful insights by exploring trends in:
- **Departures & arrivals**
- **On-time vs delayed flights**
- **Top performing routes & airports**
- **Passenger volume distribution**
- **Seasonal & monthly traffic patterns**
  
The dashboard enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions related to **operational efficiency**, **route planning**, **airport management**, and **service optimization**.

# 3. Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI Desktop** – Dashboard design & visualization
- **Power Query (M Language)** – Data cleaning & shaping
- **DAX Measures** – KPIs, calculations & performance metrics
- **Excel/CSV Dataset** – Flight-level operational data
- **Data Modeling** – Star schema, optimized relationships
- **Visualizations Used**:
  - Bar & line charts
  - KPIs & cards
  - Slicers
  - Route/Map visualizations
  - Time-series charts

  # 4. Project Goals
  
- Analyze **flight traffic trends** across airports and routes
- Identify **peak travel hours, days, and seasons**
- Examine **delay causes and frequency**
- Highlight **top routes, busiest airports**, and **highest passenger volumes**
- Compare **on-time vs delayed flights**
- Provide actionable insights for aviation planning and decision-making
- Create a user-friendly, interactive dashboard for quick exploration
